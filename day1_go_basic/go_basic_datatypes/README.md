# Go Basics Learning Project

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in Go programming language.

## What I Learned

### Variables and Data Types

- Basic variable declaration using `var` keyword
- Short variable declaration using `:=`
- Multiple variable declaration in a single line
- Constants declaration using `const`
- Different data types:
  - Integer (`int`)
  - Floating point (`float32`, `float64`)
  - String (`string`)
  - Boolean (`bool`)
  - Rune (character) (`rune`)

### Type Conversion

- Converting between numeric types (e.g., `int` to `float32`)
- Converting rune to string using `string()` function

### Basic Operations

- Arithmetic operations
  - Addition with different types
  - Integer division
  - Modulus operation
- String operations
  - String length using `len()` function

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can check by running:

```bash
go version
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd "d:\Techincal Study Notes\Go\day1_go_basic\go_basic"
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

4. To build an executable:

```bash
go build main.go
```

This will create `main.exe` which you can run directly.

## Expected Output

The program will display various examples of variable declarations, type conversions, and basic operations in Go.
